# Personal-Assistant
Personal Assistant Web App using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. I didn't followed any MVC framework in backend. It was a project for my Web Technologies course.

For front-end I used bootstrap and Jquery library. The main point of the project was to fulfill all the topics that were taught in my Web technologies course.
